# **About Me**

Hello! My name is **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

I started programming straight out of high school by teaching myself Objective-C and iOS development. Over the years I transitioned to Swift and released various projects for the iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV, including one that was featured by Apple in the New and Noteworthy section of the App Store for the productivity category.

I took a rare opportunity to manage a new pop band, called Yam Haus, that are working towards getting a deal with a major record label.

Now I'm back doing what I've missed and loved throughout that journey and am excited to be refocusing on iOS development and creating meaningful software that helps enrich people's lives!

Follow along at my [blog](/blog) to read about what I create and learn. Thanks for stopping by!
